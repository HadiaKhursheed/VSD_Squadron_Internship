# VSD_Squadron_Internship
A **4-week**, hands-on **RISC-V Embedded Firmware Internship** focused on:

1. Working on Embedded C

2. Interacting with hardware registers through APIs

3. Building core firmware utilities (GPIO, timing, serial)

4. Developing one complete peripheral driver or library

**VSDSquadron FPGA Mini:**
It is a compact and low-cost development board designed for FPGA prototyping and embedded system projects. This board provides a seamless hardware development experience with an integrated programmer, versatile GPIO access, and onboard memory, making it ideal for students, hobbyists, and developers exploring FPGA-based designs.

**Embedded Systems:** A specialized computer system designed to perform one specific task within a larger machine. 

**Embedded C:** A set of language extensions for the C programming language that allows it to interact with hardware.

**Firmware:** A specific class of computer software that provides low-level control for a device's specific hardware. It is "firmly" stored on a chip and acts as the bridge between hardware and higher-level software.

**RISC-V:** An open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) that defines how software talks to a processor. It allows anyone to design and build their own custom processors without paying royalties.

**API (Application Programming Interface):** A set of defined rules and protocols that allows one piece of software to communicate with another. It acts as a "menu" of functions that a programmer can request from a system or service.

**Library:** A collection of pre-written code that developers can reuse to perform common tasks without writing them from scratch. 

**Peripheral Driver:** A software component that allows the main processor to communicate with external hardware modules like sensors or displays. 

**Hardware Registers:** Small, high-speed storage locations inside a processor or peripheral that control how the hardware behaves. Changing a value in a register is like flipping a physical switch to turn a feature on or off.

**FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array):** An integrated circuit designed to be configured by a customer or designer after it has been manufactured. We can rewrite its internal wiring to turn it into any type of digital circuit you need.
